The dialog component can be used to display additional information or actions related to an item. It is a simple modal dialog that can be opened and closed by the user.

## Component Structure

```rust
// The dialog component must wrap all dialog elements.
Dialog {
    // The open prop determines if the dialog is currently open or closed.
    open: open(),
    // The dialog title defines the heading of the dialog.
    DialogTitle {
        "Item information"
    }
    // The dialog description provides additional information about the dialog.
    DialogDescription {
        "Here is some additional information about the item."
    }
}
```
