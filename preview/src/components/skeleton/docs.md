The Skeleton component is used to display a placeholder preview of content before the data gets loaded. This helps improve perceived performance and provides users with a visual indication that content is being loaded.

## Component Structure

```rust
Skeleton {
    // Accepts all GlobalAttributes, commonly used with style for sizing
    style: "width: 15rem; height: 1rem;",
}
```
